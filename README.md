Sample project for implementing Application Insights.

The code files within the solution have comments that begin with `TODO: Step N`, where N represents
the step that we're on. To identify the required steps, start by searching the solution for `Step 0`
and then `Step 1`, and so on.

A few bonus ones are also included which can be found by looking for `TODO: Bonus N` in the same way
that the steps are found.
